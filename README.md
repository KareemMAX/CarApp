# CarApp
A project for Advanced Software Engineering course in Cairo University - Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence.
We were assigned 2 sprints, the first was to implement the basic logic of the application. And the second was to expose a RESTful API for our application.

## Description
CarApp is ride-sharing app, that helps users to connect a driver with a rider. They can negotiate price and meet at a specific location.

## Tools used:

- [Spring-boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)

## How to use the app:
1. Download the source code using git or as a zip file from above
2. Download [Microsoft SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) and install it
3. Open Microsoft SQL ports, and setup [database schema](https://github.com/KareemMAX/CarApp/blob/master/DataBase/CarApp%20Schema.sql),
and [user credentials](https://github.com/KareemMAX/CarApp/blob/master/src/main/java/model/Database.java#L30)
4. Install Postman and use our [collection](https://github.com/KareemMAX/CarApp/blob/master/CarApp.postman_collection.json), or use our API with the tool of your choosing
